Write a blog on Difference between HTTP1.1 vs HTTP2

Versions of the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) that facilitate communication between servers and clients (such web browsers) include HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/2. They differ mostly in the following ways:

HTTP/1.1: 

1. Connection Management.

HTTP/1.1 allows persistent connections, which let you send more than one request and response over the same connection. At any one time, though, each connection can only manage one request-response cycle.

2. Response/Request Model:

Requests that are synchronous mean that before sending another on the same connection, one must wait for a response, which could result in head-of-line traffic jamming.

3. Head Compression:

No compression: Header compression is not included into HTTP/1.1, which increases overhead, particularly for headers that are repeated.

4. Parallelism

Browsers frequently open several connections to the same server in order to retrieve resources concurrently, increasing network congestion and resource utilisation.

5. Order of importance:

There is no built-in method to prioritise specific requests above others.


HTTP/2 

1. Connection Management:

With HTTP/2, a single multiplexed connection can process numerous requests and responses at once, eliminating the need to establish numerous connections and the associated overhead.

2. Request-Response Model:

By eliminating the need for each request and answer to wait for the other, asynchronous requests greatly improve performance and decrease latency.

3. Header Compression:

HTTP/2 employs HPACK compression to lessen header size, which improves efficiency and decreases overhead.

4. Parallelism

With stream multiplexing, a single connection can retrieve several resources at once across numerous streams, each with its own unique identifier. This eliminates the need for multiple connections.

5. Order of importance:

The ability to prioritise streams is a new feature of HTTP/2 that lets clients load more critical resources first.

6. The Binary Protocol:

In contrast to HTTP/1.1's text-based format, which is inefficient and prone to errors, HTTP/2 employs a binary framing layer.
